# RSA Encryption Algorithm

![RSA Logo](RSA_Security_logo2.svg.png)

This repository provides an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm and serves the purpose of teaching myself working with Java. RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that is essential for secure data transmission and digital signatures.

## Introduction

The RSA encryption algorithm, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is one of the most widely used and studied cryptographic systems. It is a public-key cryptosystem that relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers.

## Key Features

- **Public Key Encryption:** RSA uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This enables secure communication between parties without the need to share secret keys.

- **Mathematically Secure:** The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, making it a challenging task for potential attackers.

- **Digital Signatures:** RSA is widely used for creating digital signatures, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.
